\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my supervisors, Doctor Andrew Hamilton and Doctor Sahal Yacoob, for all their guidance and training during my time as a masters student. I'd also like to thank my brother Dylan Jon McConnell, who used his skills as an effects wizard to help in drawing some of the diagrams that weren't possible using \LaTeX, and Lesedi Hermans, who acted as my language editor.
